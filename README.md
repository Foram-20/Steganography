# Steganography
# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **image-based steganography** to securely hide secret messages within images. The encoded message can only be retrieved using a passcode, ensuring **confidentiality and protection** from unauthorized access.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
-**Python** – Utilized for the steganography algorithm.
-**OpenCV** – Enables image processing and pixel manipulation.
-**OS Module** – Manages file operations and image handling.

 ## Key Features:
✅ **Stealthy Data Hiding** – Information is embedded within image pixels without altering the image’s appearance.
✅ **Password-Protected Access** – The hidden data can only be decrypted using a secure passcode.
✅ **Minimal Image Distortion** – Ensures the quality and appearance of the original image remain intact.
✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** – Uses Python and OpenCV for fast and simple implementation.
✅ **Real-World Applications** – Ideal for confidential messaging, digital watermarking, and cybersecurity. 

 ## Future Enhancements:
🔹 **Advanced Cryptography** – Integrating stronger encryption techniques.
🔹 **Increased Data Capacity** – Optimizing storage without affecting image integrity.
🔹 **AI-Powered Steganography** – Using machine learning for enhanced security.
🔹 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Expanding support for mobile and web applications.
🔹 **Real-Time Secure Communication** – Implementing steganography in encrypted messaging platforms.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a secure and efficient method for concealing sensitive data in images. By leveraging steganography, it ensures safe communication across multiple domains, making it an ideal solution for individuals and organizations that require high-level data security.
